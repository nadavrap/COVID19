The basic idea is to test whether BCG vaccination regimes in different countries
is associated with different COVID-19 pandemic's oucome.

## Alignment

As different countries were exposed to the virus on different dates, and as
countries differ by population sizes, the first think to do is to align the 
dates of reports.

Alignement can be done based on first date a certain threshold was observed.
For example, the date of first report with more than 0.5 deaths per million.
